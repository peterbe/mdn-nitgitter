# mdn-nitgitter

**Makes it easy to nitpick on MDN content in git.**

A browser extension (not yet published) that helps you select pieces of text
on [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org) and find exactly
where that text comes from in the source on GitHub.

## How to hack on it

Install the latest version of [`web-ext`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)
and run:

    web-ext run --firefox nightly

or whatever works for you.
